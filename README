== soap4r ==
This is a fork of the soap4r project as imported to GitHub by spox.  
Changes have been made to fix libxml support and have it work in Ruby 1.9.
Still work todo in testing.

    IMPORTANT NOTE:
        This has been heavily modified and I am still in
        the process of testing it. I have been using the
        wsdlDriver with great success. This version includes
        my original patch, plus many other changes but I
        have not tested the gem this produces yet. That
        should be completed some time tomorrow.

    This is a modified version of the soap4r library for
    the Ruby programming language. The official verion
    can be found at:

    http://dev.ctor.org/soap4r

    This modified version simply allows soap4r to run on
    Ruby 1.9. I have not done any extensive testing, merely
    fixed things that I needed to work. If you find problems,
    please drop me a line and I'll do an update to fix it.

    Thanks!
